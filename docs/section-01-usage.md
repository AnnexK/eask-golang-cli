# Usage

This document explains how to use Eask, and provides a reference of its commands and options.

## Quickstart

Start by creating a file named `Eask` in the project root. Use `eask init`
command to create a Eask-file automatically, containing boilerplate code:

#### eask init

Eask will generate file like:

```elisp
(package "PACKAGE-NAME"
         "VERSION"
         "YOUR PACKAGE SUMMARY")

(package-file "PACKAGE-FILE")

(source "gnu")
```
