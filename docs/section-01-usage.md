## Quickstart

Start by creating a file named `Eask` in the project root. Use **eask init*
command to create a Eask-file. You will be asked to enter few questions
to create the file.

```sh
$ eask init
```

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
$ eask install-deps
```

üí° Use [-g] options for your Emacs configuration. Otherwise, it will create
a directory named `.eask` and install all dependencies into it.

### Finding Emacs

By default, Eask will use whatever the Emacs version exists in your environment
path. Use **emacs --version** to check your Emacs version.

There is currently no way to specify an Emacs version to execute.

## Commands

The gneeral syntax of the **eask** program is:

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND-OPTIONS] [COMMAND-ARGUMENTS]
```

#### eask init

Eask will generate file like:

```elisp
(package "PACKAGE-NAME"
         "VERSION"
         "YOUR PACKAGE SUMMARY")

(package-file "PACKAGE-FILE")

(source "gnu")
```

üí° See section [Examples](https://emacs-eask.github.io/eask/examples) for more information!

#### eask info

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] info
```

#### eask install-deps

To install all dependencies.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] install-deps [--dev]
```

üí° Specify option [--dev] to install dependencies from the development scope.

#### eask install

To install packages.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] install [PACKAGES..]
```

Install packages by specifying arguments:

```sh
$ eask install auto-complete helm magit
```

Or else, it will install the package from the current development:

```sh
$ eask install
```

#### eask uninstall

To uninstall/delete packages.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] uninstall [PACKAGES..]
```

Uninstall packages by specifying arguments:

```sh
$ eask uninstall dash f s
```

Or else, it will uninstall the package from the current development:

```sh
$ eask uninstall
```

#### eask package

### Management
