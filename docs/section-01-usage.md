# Usage

This document explains how to use Eask, and provides a reference of its commands and options.

## Quickstart

Start by creating a file named `Eask` in the project root. Use **eask init*
command to create a Eask-file. You will be asked to enter few questions
to create the file.

```sh
$ eask init
```

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
$ eask install-deps
```

üí° Use [-g] options for your Emacs configuration. Otherwise, it will create
a directory named `.eask` and install all dependencies into it.

### Finding Emacs

By default, Eask will use whatever the Emacs version exists in your environment
path. Use **emacs --version** to check your Emacs version.

There is currently no way to specify an Emacs version to execute.

## Commands and options

The gneeral syntax of the **eask** program is:

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND-OPTIONS] [COMMAND-ARGUMENTS]
```

#### eask init

Eask will generate file like:

```elisp
(package "PACKAGE-NAME"
         "VERSION"
         "YOUR PACKAGE SUMMARY")

(package-file "PACKAGE-FILE")

(source "gnu")

(depends-on "emacs" "26.1")
```

üí° See section [Examples](https://emacs-eask.github.io/eask/examples) for more information!

#### eask info

Show information about the project or configuration.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] info
```

#### eask install-deps

To install all dependencies.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] install-deps [--dev]
```

üí° Specify option [--dev] to install dependencies from the development scope.

#### eask install

To install packages.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] install [PACKAGES..]
```

Install packages by specifying arguments:

```sh
$ eask install auto-complete helm magit
```

Or else, it will install the package from the current development:

```sh
$ eask install
```

#### eask uninstall

To uninstall/delete packages.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] uninstall [PACKAGES..]
```

Uninstall packages by specifying arguments:

```sh
$ eask uninstall dash f s
```

Or else, it will uninstall the package from the current development:

```sh
$ eask uninstall
```

#### eask package

Build the package artifact.

```sh
$ eask package [DESTINATION]
```

If [DESTINATION] is not specified, it will export to the `/dist` folder
by default.

#### eask compile

Byte-compile files.

```sh
$ eask compile [FILES..]
```

Compile files by specifying arguments:

```sh

Or compile files that are already specified in your `Eask`-file.

```sh
$ eask compile
```

#### eask autoloads

Generate autoload file.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] autoloads
```

#### eask pkg-file

Write a package descriptor file to `project-pkg.el` in the project root.

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] pkg-file
```

`project` is the project name, as declared in `Eask`-file. See
[Multi-file Packages (elisp)](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Multi_002dfile-Packages.html#Multi_002dfile-Packages)
for details.

#### eask package-directory

```elisp
$ eask clean -g

* `clean`
* `clean-elc`

```sh
$ eask [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] clean-all
```

### Lint

## Global Options

The following options are available on all Eask commands:

#### --global, -g

Use `~/.emacs.d/` instead of package development environment. This is used
for Emacs configuration.

Install package `auto-complete` for your Emacs configuration:

```sh
$ eask install auto-complete -g
```

#### --development, --dev

Notify command with development scope enabled.

If we attempt to install development dependencies:

```sh
$ eask install --dev
```

#### --force, -f

Force command's execution.

Force to uninstall package `dash` even it's dependencies from other packages

```sh
$ eask uninstall dash -f
```

#### --debug

Enable debug information.

This is equivalent to:

```elisp
(setq debug-on-error t)
```

#### --strict

Trigger error instead of warnings.

For instance, in **eask compile**:

```elisp
(setq byte-compile-error-on-warn t)
```

#### --allow-error

Continue the execution without killing the Emacs.

#### --insecure

Connect archives with HTTP instead of HTTPS.

#### --timestamps, --no-timestamps

#### --https-proxy <proxy>

Set Emacs proxy for HTTPS only.

#### --no-proxy <pattern>

Do not use a proxy for any URL matching pattern.

**<pattern>** is an Emacs regular expression.

#### --verbose, -v

```sh
--verbose 4
```

#### --version

Show version number.

#### --help

Show help.
