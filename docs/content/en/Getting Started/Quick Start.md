```sh
$ npm install -g @emacs-eask/eask
```

Start by creating a file named `Eask` in the project root. Use **eask init**
command to create a Eask-file. You will be asked to enter few questions
to create the file.

```sh
$ eask init
```

To install all dependencies, run:

```sh
$ eask install-deps
```

{{< hint ok >}}
ðŸ’¡ *Use **-g** options for your Emacs configuration. Otherwise, it will create
a directory named **.eask** and install all dependencies into it.*

## ðŸ”­ Finding Emacs

By default, Eask will use whatever the Emacs version exists in your environment
path. Use **emacs --version** to check your Emacs version.

There is currently no way to specify an Emacs version to execute.
