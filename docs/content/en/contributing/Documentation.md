Eask includes a comprehensive user guide. Please try to extend it accordingly while
you implement new features.

The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://gohugo.io/), using [Hugo]() and GitHub Pages.
The former is the static site generator, and the latter is the static web pages hosting service
from GitHub.
