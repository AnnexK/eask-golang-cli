title: Introduction

Eask is a command-line tool that helps you build, lint, and test Emacs Lisp
packages. It creates a clean environment to sandbox your elisp code without
influencing your personal configuration. Eask aims to be:

* **Consistent** enough to sandbox across all systems
* **General** enough to have Emacsers often use commands (byte-compile, checkdoc, etc)
* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presence of user's errors
* **Dependency-free** so that the tool can be run on any platform

## ‚ùì Why Eask?

`Eask` has the same philosophy as Cask, see their site [Why Cask?](https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html#introduction-why-cask)
to understand why you should use Eask (or Cask).

Many tools like
[Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask),
[makem.sh](https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh),
or [Eldev](https://doublep.github.io/eldev/)
don't **"really"** support Windows. `Cask` has dropped support for Legacy Windows,
`makem.sh` runs on bash, `Eldev` does support Windows, but the author doesn't use
it on Windows (not having full tests, see their
[CI workflows](https://github.com/doublep/eldev/actions/workflows/test.yml)).
`Eask` aims to adapt all platforms, including `Linux`, `macOS`, and `Windows`.
It focuses on the cross-platform capability and the consistency between each
OS. If Eask works on your machine, then it will work on any platform.

Here are our suggestions; if you plan to work on an OS-specific package (never
going to other platforms), go for other tools. On the other hand, Eask aims to
provide the best consistency between each OS. Alternatively, if you want to
learn a tool that works everywhere, Eask is one of the best choices.
