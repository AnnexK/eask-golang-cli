title: Introduction

Eask is a command-line tool that helps you build, lint, and test Emacs Lisp
packages. It creates a clean environment to sandbox your elisp code without
influencing your personal configuration. Eask aims to be:

* **Consistent** enough to sandbox across all systems
* **General** enough to have Emacsers often use commands (byte-compile, checkdoc, etc)
* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presense of user's errors
* **Dependency-free** so that the tool can be run on any platform

## ‚ùì Why Eask?

Eask is heavily inspired by Cask, so they are somewhat related! This tool focuses
on consistency! [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) and [makem.sh](https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh)
both rely on bash which Windows doesn't run on by default. If you use WSL or other
environment system file Cygwin/MSYS ; then this may not be the tool you are looking
for! üëÄ
