## ‼️ Error when running a Eask command

If you run a Eask command and get an error, there are a few things you can try
yourself:

* Make sure that you have the latest Eask version. You can determine the
current Eask version with `eask --version`.
* Upgrade Eask with `eask upgrade-eask`.

> ⚠️ Warning
>
> If you installed Eask with `npm`, then you should probably upgrade it through
> `npm`. Otherwise you would just have to ensure `git` is installed.
