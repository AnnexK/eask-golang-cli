## About Eask file

`Eask` is the magic file that `eask` will read it as init file in Emacs. The
syntax are very similar to `Cask` file, but different.

```el
(source "gnu")

(package "your-package" "1.0.0" "Your package description")

(package-file "your-package-file.el")
```

Remember, `Eask` is just the regular elisp file, and should be read it from
Emacs itself!

```el
; Regular Eask file content...

(setq byte-compile-error-on-warn t)  ; Singal error if warning occurred
```
