Eask is a command-line tool that helps you build, lint, and test Emacs Lisp
packages. It creates a clean environment to sandbox your elisp code without
influencing your personal confiugration. Eask aims to be:

* **Consistent** enough to sandbox across all systems
* **General** enough to have Emacsers often used commands (byte-compile, checkdoc, etc)
* **Robust** enough to provide useful results even in the presense of user's errors
* **Dependency-free** so that the tool can be run on any platform
