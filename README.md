Eask is heavily inspired by Cask, so they are somewhat related! This tool focuses
on consistency! [Cask]() and [makem.sh]() both rely on bash which Windows doesn't
run on by default. If you use WSL or other environment system file Cygwin/MSYS
; then this may not be the tool you are looking for! ðŸ‘€
